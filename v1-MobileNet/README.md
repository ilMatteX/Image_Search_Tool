# 🔹 Mattex Image Search – v1: MobileNet Edition

A smart desktop application for **visual image similarity search**, powered by **MobileNetV2** and **PyQt5**.

This version focuses on **fast and accurate visual search**, making it ideal for **3D artists**, **texture managers**, **designers**, and anyone working with large image collections organized by folders and subfolders.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **Image indexing with MobileNetV2** (CNN)
- ♻️ **Incremental indexing**: only new images are processed
- 🔍 **Cosine similarity**-based search
- 🖼️ **Rich result viewer**:
  - Image thumbnail preview
  - Similarity score (%)
  - Category / subcategory
  - Full file path with quick open
- 💾 Automatic backup of index files before each update
- 🧭 Folder-based organization with category/subcategory support
- ✅ Stable, standalone, and **offline** — no internet needed

## 📂 Folder Structure

Example:

```
RootFolder/
├── Category1/
│   ├── SubcategoryA/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.jpg
├── Category2/
│   ├── SubcategoryB/
│   │   ├── image3.png
...
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Indexing**:
   - Loads images from selected folder (recursively)
   - Processes only new images (compares with existing paths)
   - Uses `MobileNetV2` to extract deep visual features
   - Saves them into:
     - `index.npy` → image feature vectors
     - `paths.txt` → file paths in order
   - Backup created before overwrite

2. **Similarity Search**:
   - Load an image of your choice
   - The app compares it to the index using **cosine similarity**
   - Top matches (up to 1000) are displayed with preview and metadata
